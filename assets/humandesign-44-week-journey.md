Human Design 44-Week Deconditioning Journey
A Year-Long Guided Transformation with Audrey
Following Ra Uru Hu's Teaching Sequence: Form First, Then Function
Saturday Weekly Sessions | Filipino-Centered Approach

Program Philosophy
This 44-week journey honors Ra Uru Hu's foundational teaching: "The vehicle (body) is what allows the Personality to experience its geometry." We cannot reach correctness of mind or purpose until the body is properly aligned.
Following Ra's sequence, we begin with ancient wisdom foundations, then address the Four Transformations in proper order:
Determination (Diet/Digestion)
Environment (Where your body thrives)
Perspective (How you see)
Motivation (What drives you)
Only after understanding how to nourish and place your vehicle correctly do we explore Type, Strategy, and Authority—because these mechanics work best when your body is already aligned.
Core Principles:
* Form precedes function; body alignment precedes mental clarity
* The 7-year cellular deconditioning cycle begins with proper nourishment
* Filipino cultural healing integrated throughout
* Ancient wisdom meets modern application
* Community support accelerates transformation
