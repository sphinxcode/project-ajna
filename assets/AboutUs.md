VISION

What we see as needed right now

A chance for every Filipino to know they’re not broken—just different by design.

We envision a Philippines where “pagod” isn’t a badge of honor, where rest isn’t laziness, and where being different isn’t something to fix. A future where families understand each other’s energetic blueprints instead of forcing everyone into the same mold. Where Filipinos stop sacrificing their authentic nature for approval, and start living from their cellular truth.

We see communities of Filipinos who’ve stopped apologizing for who they are—Projectors who guide without guilt, Generators who respond without rushing, Manifestors who initiate without asking permission, and Reflectors who take their time without shame.

This is a Philippines waking up to 5,000 years of wisdom that’s been waiting for us all along.


MISSION

What we’re here to do

We are here to make this profound system accessible, practical, and culturally relevant for Filipinos navigating family pressures, work demands, money wounds, and the collective conditioning that tells success has a template.


We don’t just teach Human Design theory. We walk with you through the actual deconditioning process, honoring Ra Uru Hu’s original sequence: nourish your vehicle first (Determination), place it correctly (Environment), clear your vision (Perspective), align your drive (Motivation)—and only then learn how to navigate life through your Type, Strategy, and Authority.

OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU

We will never:

- Make you choose between family and authenticity
- Teach Human Design as just another personality test
- Overwhelm you with information before body alignment

We will always:

- Start with your body’s wisdom, not your mind’s questions
- Honor your pace and your unique journey
- Provide culturally relevant examples and practices
- Hold space for the discomfort of change
- Celebrate your small wins as sacred victories
- Walk beside you as a guide, not above you as a guru
- Remind you: you’re not broken, just misaligned

 WHY “TOTAL” HUMAN DESIGN?

Because half-truths don’t create whole transformations.

Most Human Design teachings give you your Type and send you on your way. But Ra Uru Hu knew the secret: **you can’t drive the car correctly if the engine isn’t properly fueled and the vehicle isn’t in the right environment.**

Total Human Design means:

- The complete sequence: Variables → PHS → Type → Mechanics
- The full picture: body, mind, emotion, spirit, culture
- The whole journey: awareness → experimentation → embodiment → integration
- The ancient roots: I-Ching wisdom meeting modern application
- The collective context: individual sovereignty preparing for 2027

We don’t give you fragments. We give you the total map—then walk with you as you navigate it at your own pace, in your own way, honoring your own design.

THE INVITATION

This isn’t about becoming someone new.

This is about unbecoming everything that was never you in the first place.

This is about remembering that your exhaustion isn’t laziness—it’s misalignment.  
That your sensitivity isn’t weakness—it’s wisdom.  
That your difference isn’t a problem—it’s your purpose.

**You’ve been living someone else’s life in your body.**

It’s time to come home.

Welcome to Total Human Design.  
Welcome home to yourself.
